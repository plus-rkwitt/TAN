# Topological Attention (TAN)

Dear visitor,

thank you for your interest in our work and welcome to this repository.

The latter is dedicated, to provide the official (PyTorch) implementation of 

**Topological Attention for Time Series Forecasting**     
S. Zeng, F. Graf, C. Hofer and R. Kwitt     
*NeurIPS 2021*.

Unfortunately, our code base has not yet reached the status we are aiming for.
I.e., a self-contained version of our model with multiple applications, including
[electricity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014)
and [traffic](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PEMS-SF) data, as well as thorough documentation and replication of
the results in the paper. 

We apologize and
ask for a little more patience; stay tuned :slightly_smiling_face: ! 

*Code release expected by September 2023.*
